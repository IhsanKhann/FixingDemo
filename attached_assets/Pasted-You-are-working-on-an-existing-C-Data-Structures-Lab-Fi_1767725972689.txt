You are working on an existing C++ Data Structures Lab Final Project titled
"Social Media Feed Manager".

CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
1. DO NOT rewrite or refactor existing working modules unless they are broken.
2. DO NOT change existing logic, data structures, or file formats if they already work.
3. Only ADD missing functionality.
4. Maintain strict C++ separation:
   - .h files contain declarations only
   - .cpp files contain implementations only
5. Ensure there are ZERO linker errors.
6. The project must compile with:
   g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o app
7. After git pull, the project must compile and run without manual fixes.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTED MODULES (VERIFY FIRST):
- User Management
- Notifications (Priority Queue)
- Browsing History (Stack)
- Exit system

STEP 1 — VERIFICATION:
Analyze the existing codebase and VERIFY whether:
- User Management works correctly (BST insertion, search, follow/unfollow)
- Notifications work with correct priority order (COMMENT > LIKE > FOLLOW)
- History stack works correctly (push/pop/back)
If any of these are broken, FIX them minimally without redesign.

STEP 2 — ADD MISSING MODULES (ONLY THESE):
Add the following modules exactly as described, without touching verified working code:

1. Post Management
   - Doubly Linked List for posts
   - Fields: PostID, UserID, Content, Timestamp, Likes, Comments
   - Create, edit, delete, display posts
   - Timestamp-based sorting (newest first)

2. Interaction System
   - Like / Unlike posts
   - Comment on posts
   - Singly Linked List for comments
   - Validation:
     - Cannot like own post
     - Cannot comment empty text

3. Feed Generation
   - Collect posts from followed users
   - Merge posts by timestamp
   - Display top 20 posts
   - Use Linked List

4. File Persistence (if missing)
   - users.txt
   - posts.txt
   - connections.txt
   - Load on startup
   - Save on changes

STEP 3 — INTEGRATION:
- Connect new modules to the existing menu system
- Add menu options ONLY for missing features
- Keep existing menu options unchanged
- Ensure no circular dependencies

STEP 4 — CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use header guards
- No global variables unless already present
- No STL containers unless explicitly allowed (priority_queue is allowed)
- Clear separation of responsibility per file

STEP 5 — FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:
After completing changes, provide:
1. A summary of VERIFIED modules (unchanged)
2. A list of ADDED modules
3. A list of files that were modified
4. A list of new files created
5. Compilation command
6. Run command
7. Any assumptions made

OPTIONAL GUI (DO NOT ADD UNLESS SAFE):
If GUI is added, use Dear ImGui minimally and ensure console mode still works.

IMPORTANT:
If a feature is already partially implemented, COMPLETE it instead of duplicating it.
If something is missing, ADD it cleanly.

DO NOT overengineer. This is a data structures lab project, not a production system.
